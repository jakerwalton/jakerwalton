# <ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!/>

My name is Jake, I'm currently a software engineering student at General Assembly! I have always had a strong passion for crafting really cool things with nothing but hard work and my own two hands. If you like my work here, feel free to [reach out](mailto:admin@cloudhadoop.com) and let me know!
